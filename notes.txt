Variables:
    Content changes
    Asking input 

Whenever we refresh everything is set to be nulled there are methods to save local states too 

prompt funtion return string alert return type is void

variable philosphy we just declare it as var so we can change it Whenever we want at differnt data type and that will be okaay too.
Assigning variable to new variable makes the copy of the variable and if yo change the value of first variable it will not change value of new variable.

if you declare anything in js it is attached to window object but that can be conflicated when you have multiple variables and large code 
so that is where concept of IIFE comes in picture : Imeadiatly invoked funtions defination
if we did not put var keyword on age it is gonna attached to global window and defeting purpose of whole IIFE 
Just in time compliation

block variable by let, const(not allowed to change)
and funtion variable by var

let vs var 
let don't attach to window it is attached to declarative envirnment
